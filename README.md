## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Graph-Greener

1. **Create a private repository on GitHub named `priv`.**  
   This keeps your main projects clean and dedicated for this purpose.

2. **Clone your `priv` repository to your local machine:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/priv.git
   cd priv
   ```

3. **Create a file named `data.txt` inside the cloned `priv` folder.**  
   This file will be modified by the script to generate commits.

4. **Copy the `main.py` script into the `priv` folder.**  
   You can download `main.py` from this repository or copy it manually.

5. **Run the script:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Follow the on-screen prompts:**  
   - Enter the number of commits you want to generate.  
   - Confirm or change the repository path (default is current directory).  
   - Confirm or change the filename to modify (default is `data.txt`).

7. **The script will create backdated commits and push them to your `priv` repository.**

8. **Check your GitHub profile after a few minutes to see your contribution graph fill up with green squares!**
